#Cat-Image-Generator

This app utilizes basic Swift functionality to deliver an app that can generate cat images.

I use "The Cat API":  " https://thecatapi.com/ " to generate these images

This app is meant to make people laugh and brighten people's days with some cat images.

Currently, the app uses a slider to exit the main page
Then, the user is asked for some personal information to get started (no validity checks implemented yet).
Then, the user can click the submit button to continue using the cat image generator.
A new cat image is generated each time the user taps the circle on the bottom of the screen.

Additionally, there is a toggle for background music. It can be loud, so I have it set to off automatically. 

Additionally, this is the first iteration of the app. I will continue to make updates to the code, adding functionality and a better GUI
